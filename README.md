The Hungarian algorithm is a combinatorial optimization method, that solves the assignment problem in polynomial time, and which anticipated later primal-dual methods. In other words, based on a matrix of possible combinations of costs, the algorithm returns an ordered collcetion of matches, having the lowest combined cost, thus being the most optimal assignment.

***

#### The Algorithm
The example below, shows how to use and apply the algorithm.  
It defines a two-dimensional array, passes it to algorithm, and recieves a result of an array of matched columns for each row (x) passed.
```csharp
int[,] costs = new int[x,y]();
int[] result = HungarianAlgorithm.FindAssignments(costs);
```
